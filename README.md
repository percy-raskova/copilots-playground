## 🌟 Chronolexical Emoji Calculus (CEC)

Welcome to the most bizarre and esoteric programming language you've never asked for! 

CEC is a programming language where:
- ⏰ **Time flows backwards** - programs execute from bottom to top
- 🔮 **Variables are emoji** - because why not?
- 💕 **Operators have emotions** - math with feelings
- ⟨⟩ **Quantum superposition** - values can be multiple things at once
- 🕳️ **The void is real** - and it's a datatype

### Quick Example

```cec
⏰BEGIN⏰ ⏳9999⏳

🕳️🖨️(🐱)!              🗨️ Print the result
🐱 ⟸ 42 💕 13!         🗨️ Add with love: 42 + 13
🐱 ⟺ 0?               🗨️ Declare variable 🐱

⏰END⏰ 😊
```

### Documentation

- **[LANGUAGE_SPEC.md](LANGUAGE_SPEC.md)** - Complete formal grammar and language specification
- **[QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick reference guide for syntax and operators
- **[EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)** - Example programs showcasing language features
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)** - Implementation guide for building an interpreter

### Sample Programs

- **[battle_simulator.cec](battle_simulator.cec)** - RPG battle system with quantum dice rolls
- **[time_traveler.cec](time_traveler.cec)** - Time travel adventure story

### Features

- 🔄 **Temporal Reversal**: Bottom-to-top execution
- 🎲 **Quantum Computing**: Superposition and state collapse
- 😊 **Emotional Operators**: Math that feels
- 🌀 **Quantum Loops**: Iterate through superpositions
- 🤔 **Reality Checks**: Assert your expectations
- 💭 **Existential Comments**: Document your temporal logic

### Getting Started

1. Read the [Language Specification](LANGUAGE_SPEC.md)
2. Check out the [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
3. Explore [Examples](EXAMPLES.md)
4. Try writing your own `.cec` programs!

### Philosophy

CEC embraces the absurd while remaining (theoretically) Turing complete. It questions every assumption about programming languages:

- Why should time flow forward?
- Why can't operators have emotions?
- Why not use emoji as variable names?
- What if values existed in multiple states simultaneously?

Welcome to Chronolexical Emoji Calculus. **The future is behind us.** 🚀
